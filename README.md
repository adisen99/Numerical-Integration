# Numerical-Integration
Python and MATLAB code to find the definite integral of a user-defined function within given limits and defined iterations.

### Included files
There are in total 3 files in the repository, each following a different algorithms, namely **Trapezoidal** Rule and the **two Simpson's Rules**. Code for the **Legendre-Gauss Quadrature formula** will be added soon. Each folder contains **MATLAB or .m** and **Python or .py**. So you can use either syntax and program/language to numerically determine the roots of an equation/function using the given Methods or algorithms.

To access the files you can either Download the zip file or use the following command from your terminal


``
git clone https://github.com/adisen99/Numerical-Integration.git
``

then


``
cd Numerical-Integration 
``

### Note-


Then you can access the `.py files` or `.m` files depending on the program you wish to run. Please note than **Simpson's3** is the **Simpson's 1/3** and the **Simpson's8** is the **Simpson's 3/8** rule. The **Simpson's3** folder contains two MATLAB files one of which has a much simpler algorithm as compared to the other more difficult one. Also the **Trapezoidal_Rule** folder contains two MATLAB and two Python files. One set is marked as easy and thus has a much easier algorithm, however the user can choose to run the more complex ones.


## Happy Coding
